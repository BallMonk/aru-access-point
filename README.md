aru access point
====

This project descript aru access point data model.
We just focus on state data on just one single access point.

1. 
----
Possiblly we involve some data about more than one access point, like swarm, cluster, mesh, etc...,
we still discuss them on one single access point.

2.
----
We model the state data of access point, but not about the statics data.
The RPC is not in our purpose, though it a import part to discript the access point.
